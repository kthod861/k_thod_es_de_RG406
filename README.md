# k_thod_es_de_RG406
A personnal modification of [RobZombie elementarial theme](https://github.com/RobZombie9043/elementerial-es-de) for my Anbernic RG 406V .

Highly reduced the amount of options to my needs (grid only, one size).

A great way to learn how ES-DE themes works.

Almost all systems arts have been tweaked.

Should fit any 4:3 ratio / 960x720 resolution.

Install :
Download and extract to ES-DE theme folder
